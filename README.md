## Lecture 2 (Feb 8)

* Matrix multiplication by blocks and columns-times-rows.  Complexity: standard algorithm for (m×p)⋅(p×n) is [Θ(mnp): roughly proportional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation) to mnp for large m,n,p, regardless of how we rearrange it into blocks. (There also [exist theoretically better](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_complexity_of_matrix_multiplication), but highly impractical, algorithms.)
* Briefly reviewed the "famous four" matrix factorizations: [LU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LU_decomposition), [diagonalization XΛX⁻¹ or QΛQᵀ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigendecomposition_of_a_matrix), [QR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_decomposition), and the [SVD UΣVᵀ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_value_decomposition).  QR and QΛQᵀ in the columns-times-rows picture, especially QΛQᵀ (diagonalization for real A=Aᵀ) as a sum of symmetric rank-1 projections.
* The [four fundamental subspaces](https://web.mit.edu/18.06/www/Essays/newpaper_ver3.pdf) for an m×n matrix A of rank r, mapping "inputs" x∈ℝⁿ to "outputs" Ax∈ℝᵐ: the "input" subspaces C(Aᵀ) (row space, dimension r) and its [orthogonal complement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal_complement) N(A) (nullspace, dimension n–r); and the "output" subspaces C(A) (column space, dimension r) and its orthogonal complement N(Aᵀ) (left nullspace, dimension m–r).

## *Optional* Julia Tutorial: Wed Feb 8 @ 5pm via Zoom

* Virtually via Zoom.  See [the recording](https://mit.zoom.us/rec/share/n2B1-t0NoGd5pr9gNBLgDYme159TstNttH5PLMcYPsEFEThCohKIJPsLrZXRhaZZ.LMM65H-ATiUFXkPf?startTime=1675893372000) (MIT only).

A basic overview of the Julia programming environment for numerical computations that we will use in 18.06 for simple computational exploration.   This (Zoom-based) tutorial will cover what Julia is and the basics of interaction, scalar/vector/matrix arithmetic, and plotting — we'll be using it as just a "fancy calculator" and no "real programming" will be required.

* [Tutorial materials](https://github.com/mitmath/julia-mit) (and links to other resources)

If possible, try to install Julia on your laptop beforehand using the instructions at the above link.  Failing that, you can run Julia in the cloud (see instructions above).

## Lecture 3 (Feb 10)

* Orthogonal bases and unitary matrices "Q".

Choosing the right "coordinate system" (= "right basis" for linear transformations) is a key aspect of data science, in order to reveal and simplify information.  The "nicest" bases are often orthonormal.  (The opposite is a *nearly* linearly dependent "ill-conditioned" basis, which can greatly distort data.)

Orthonormal bases ⟺ QᵀQ=I, hence basis coefficients c=Qᵀx from dot products.  QQᵀ is orthogonal projection onto C(Q).  A square Q with orthonormal columns is known as a ["orthogonal matrix"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal_matrix) or (more generally) as a ["unitary matrix"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unitary_matrix): it has Qᵀ=Q⁻¹ (*both* its rows and columns are orthonormal).  Qx preserves length ‖x‖=‖Qx‖ and dot products (angles) x⋅y=(Qx)⋅(Qy).  Less obviously: *any* square matrix that preserves length must be unitary.

Some important examples of unitary matrices:
* [2×2 rotation matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_matrix)
* the identity matrix I
* any [permutation matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation_matrix) P which re-orders a vector, and is simply a re-ordering of the rows/cols of I
* [Hadamard matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadamard_matrix): unitary matrices Hₙ/√n where Hₙ has entries of ±1 only.  For n=2ᵏ they are easy to construct recursively, and are known as [Walsh–Hadamard transforms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadamard_transform).  (See also the Julia [Hadamard package](https://github.com/JuliaMath/Hadamard.jl).)
* discrete [Haar wavelets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haar_wavelet), which are unitary after a diagonal scaling and consist of entries ±1 and 0.  They are a form of ["time-frequency analysis"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time%E2%80%93frequency_analysis) because they reveal information about *both* how oscillatory a vector is ("frequency domain") and *where* the oscillations occur ("time domain").
* orthonormal eigenvectors can be found for any real-symmetric ("Hermitian") matrix A=Aᵀ: A=QΛQᵀ
* the [SVD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_value_decomposition) A=UΣVᵀ of *any* matrix A gives (arguably) the "best" orthonormal basis U for C(A) and the "best" orthonormal basis V for C(Aᵀ), which reveal a lot about A.
* orthonormal eigenvectors can *also* be found for any *unitary* matrix!  (The proof is similar to that for Hermitian matrices, but the eigenvalues |λ|=1 in this case.) Often, unitary matrices are used to describe *symmetries* of problems, and their eigenvectors can be thought of as a kind of "generalized Fourier transform".  (All of the familar Fourier transforms, including Fourier series, sine/cosine transforms, and discrete variants thereof, can be derived in this way. For example, the symmetry of a circle gives the Fourier series, and the symmetry of a sphere gives a "spherical-harmonic transform".)  For example, eigenvectors of a [cyclic shift permutation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_shift) give the [discrete Fourier transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_Fourier_transform), which is famously computed using [FFT algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform).

**Further reading**: Textbook section 1.5 (orthogonality), 1.6 (eigenproblems), and 4.1 (Fourier); [OCW lecture 3](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-065-matrix-methods-in-data-analysis-signal-processing-and-machine-learning-spring-2018/resources/lecture-3-orthonormal-columns-in-q-give-q2019q-i/). The fact that preserving lengths implies unitarity is not obvious, but is proved in various textbooks; a concise summary is [found here](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3313702/does-preservation-of-induced-norm-imply-unitarity).  The relationship between symmetries and Fourier-like transforms can be most generally studied through the framework of "group representation theory"; see e.g. textbooks on "group theory in physics" like [Inui et al. (1996)](https://www.amazon.com/Applications-Physics-Springer-Solid-State-Sciences/dp/3540604456).  Of course, there are whole books *just* on the discrete Fourier transform (DFT), *just* on wavelet transforms, etcetera, and you can find lots of material online at many levels of sophistication.

## Lecture 4 (Feb 13)

* Eigenproblems, diagonalization, complex inner products, and the spectral theorem.

Reviewed eigenvectors/eigenvalues Ax=λx, which make a square matrix act like a scalar λ.   For an m×m matrix A, you get m eigenvalues λₖ from the roots (possibly repeated) of the [characteristic polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristic_polynomial) det(A-λΙ), and you almost always get m independent eigenvalues xₖ (except in the very rare case of a [defective matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defective_matrix)).

Went through the example of the 4×4 cyclic-shift permutation P from last lecture, and showed that P⁴x=x ⥰ λ⁴=1 ⥰ λ=±1,±i.  We can then easily obtain the corresponding eigenvectors, and put them into the "discrete Fourier transform" matrix F.

I then claimed that the eigenvectors (properly scaled) are orthonormal, so that F is unitary, but there is a catch: we need to **generalize our definition of "dot"/inner product** for complex vectors and matrices.   For complex vectors, the dot product x⋅y is `conj`(xᵀ)y (`conj`=[complex conjugate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_conjugate)), *not* xᵀy.   And the length of a vector is then  ‖x‖² = x⋅x = ∑ᵢ|xᵢ|², which is always ≥ 0 (and = 0 only for x=0).   The ["adjoint"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugate_transpose) `conj`(xᵀ) is sometimes denoted "xᴴ" (or x<sup>*</sup> in math, or x<sup>†</sup> in physics).   A unitary matrix is now more generally one for which QᴴQ=I, and we see that our Fourier matrix F is indeed unitary.  And unitary matrices still preserve lengths (and inner products) with the complex inner product.

If we do a **change of basis** x=Bc, then Ax=λx is transformed to Cc=λc, where C=B⁻¹AB.  C and A are called [similar matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_similarity), and we see that they are just the same linear operator in different bases; similar matrices always have identical eigenvalues, and eigenvectors transformed by a factor of B.

The most important change of basis for eigenproblems is changing to the *basis of eigenvectors* X, and showed that this gives the [diagonalizaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagonalizable_matrix) X⁻¹AX=Λ ⟺ **A = XΛX⁻¹**.  However, this basis may be problematic in a variety of ways if the eigenvectors are nearly dependent (X is nearly singular or "ill-conditioned", corresponding to A being *nearly defective*).

The *nice* case of diagonalization is when you have **orthonormal eigenvectors** X=Q, and it turns out that this arises **whenever A commutes with its conjugate-transpose Aᴴ** (these are called [normal matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugate_transpose)), and give **A=QΛQᴴ**.  Two important cases are:
* [Hermitian matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermitian_matrix) A=Aᴴ, and especially the special case of **real-symmetric matrices** (real A=Aᵀ) — not only are their eigenvectors orthogonal, but their eigenvalues λ are **real**.  In fact, if A is real-symmetric, then its *eigenvectors* are real too, and we can work with a purely real diagonalization A=QΛQᵀ.
* Unitary matrices Aᴴ=A⁻¹.  In this case, we can easily show that |λ|=1, and then prove orthogonality of eigenvectors from the fact that unitary matrices preserve inner products.

* Complex numbers and vectors: See [18.06 lecture 26](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/video-lectures/lecture-26-complex-matrices-fast-fourier-transform/) on complex matrices.  This [brief review of complex numbers](https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/ee102/complex-primer.pdf) (from Stephen Boyd at Stanford) is at about the level we need.  There are many more basic reviews, e.g. from [Khan academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra2/x2ec2f6f830c9fb89:complex), that you can find online.
* Similar matrices are discussed in [18.06 lecture 28](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/video-lectures/lecture-28-similar-matrices-and-jordan-form/), and diagonalization is in [18.06 lecture 22](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/video-lectures/lecture-22-diagonalization-and-powers-of-a/).
* Hermitian (real-symmetric) matrices: [18.06 lecture 25](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/video-lectures/lecture-25-symmetric-matrices-and-positive-definiteness/).

## Lecture 5 (Feb 15)

* (Symmetric/Hermitian) positive definite ("SPD") matrices A=Aᵀ: λ > 0 ⟺ xᵀAx > 0 (for x ≠ 0) ⟺ A = BᵀB (B full column rank) ⟺ pivots > 0 (in Gaussian elimination / LU or [Cholesky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesky_decomposition) factorization) ⟺ ...  (but it does *not* mean all entries of A are necessarily positive or vice versa!)
* BᵀB matrices arise in SVDs, least-squares, statistics (covariance matrices), and many other problems.
* Positive-definiteness of the [Hessian matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hessian_matrix) Hᵢⱼ=∂²f/∂xᵢ∂xⱼ is the key test for determining whether x∈ℝⁿ is a [local minimum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_and_minimum) of f(x), since f(x+δ)=f(x)+∇fᵀδ + ½δᵀHδ + (higher-order).   For example, H=2A for the [convex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_function) [quadratic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_form) "bowl" function f(x)=xᵀAx+bᵀx
* Analogous definitions of "positive semidefinite" (> 0 replaced by ≥ 0) and negative definite/semidefinite (< 0 / ≤ 0).

In Julia, the [`isposdef`](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/LinearAlgebra/#LinearAlgebra.isposdef) function checks whether a matrix is positive definite, and does so using a Cholesky factorization (which is just Gaussian elimination speeded up 2× for SPD matrices, and fails if it encounters a negative pivot).   See also [these lecture slides from Stanford](http://www.seas.ucla.edu/~vandenbe/133A/lectures/chol.pdf) for more properties, examples, and applications of SPD matrices.  See the [matrix calculus course at MIT](https://github.com/mitmath/matrixcalc) for a more general presentation of derivatives, gradients, and second derivatives (Hessians) of functions with vector inputs/outputs.

## Lecture 6 (Feb 17)

* "Reduced"/"compact" SVD A=UᵣΣᵣVᵣᵀ=∑σₖuₖvₖᵀ, "full" SVD A=UΣVᵀ, and "thin" SVD (what computers actually return, with zero singular values replaced by tiny roundoff errors).
* Uᵣ and Vᵣ as the "right" bases for C(A) and C(Aᵀ). Avₖ=σₖvₖ
* SVD and eigenvalues: U and V as eigenvectors of AAᵀ and AᵀA, respectively, and σₖ² as the positive eigenvalues.
* Deriving the SVD from eigenvalues: the key step is showing that AAᵀ and AᵀA share the same positive eigenvalues, and λₖ=σₖ², with eigenvectors related by a factor of A. From there you can work backwards to the SVD.

## Lecture 9 (Feb 24)

* [pseudo-inverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%E2%80%93Penrose_inverse) A⁺=VΣ⁺Uᵀ
* Least-squares: solve Ax≈b by minimizing ‖b-Ax‖ ⟺ solving AᵀAx̂=Aᵀb
* 4 methods for least squares: (1) Normal equations AᵀAx̂=Aᵀb (the fastest method, but least robust to roundoff errors etc); (2) orthogonalization A=QR ⟹ Rx̂=Qᵀb (much more robust, this is essentially what `A \ b` does in Julia for non-square `A`); (3) pseudo-inverse x̂=A⁺b ([`pinv(A)*b`](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/LinearAlgebra/#LinearAlgebra.pinv) in Julia; this lets you "regularize" the problem by dropping tiny singular values); (4) ["ridge" or "Tikhonov" regularization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ridge_regression) (AᵀA + δ²I)⁻¹Aᵀb ⟶ x̂ as δ→0 (δ≠0 is useful to "regularize" ill-conditioned fitting problems where A has nearly dependent columns, making the solutions more robust to errors).
* [Least-squares demo](https://nbviewer.org/github/mitmath/1806/blob/fall22/notes/Least-Square%20Fitting.ipynb)

**Further reading:** Textbook section II.2 and [OCW lecture 9](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-065-matrix-methods-in-data-analysis-signal-processing-and-machine-learning-spring-2018/resources/lecture-9-four-ways-to-solve-least-squares-problems/).  Many advanced linear-algebra texts talk about the practical aspects of roundoff errors in QR and least-squares, e.g. *Numerical Linear Algebra* by Trefethen and Bau (the 18.335 textbook). A nice historical review can be found in the article [Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization: 100 years and more](https://doi.org/10.1002/nla.1839).  Rarely (on a computer) explicitly form AᵀA or solve the normal equations: it turns out that this greatly exacerbates the sensitivity to numerical errors (in 18.335, you would learn that it squares the [condition number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condition_number)). Instead, we typically use the A=QR factorization and solve Rx̂=Qᵀb.  Better yet, just do `A \ b` (in Julia or Matlab) or the equivalent in other languages (e.g. [`numpy.linalg.lstsq`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.linalg.lstsq.html)), which will use a good algorithm.   (Even professionals can [get confused about this](https://discourse.julialang.org/t/efficient-way-of-doing-linear-regression/31232/33?u=stevengj).)

## Lecture 10 (Feb 27)

* Training vs test data: [VMLS slides p. 294](https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/vmls/vmls-slides.pdf#page=294)
* Conditioning: κ(A) = (max σ)/(min σ) is the [condition number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condition_number) of a matrix A, and gives us a bound on the "amplification" ‖Δx‖/‖x‖ ≤ κ(a) ‖Δb‖/‖b‖ of the relative error from inputs (b) to outputs (x) when solving Ax=b (including least-squares).   "Ill-conditioned problems" (κ≫1) magnify noise and other errors, and typically require some **regularization** (e.g. dropping smallest σ's) that **trades off robustness for accuracy** ‖b-Ax‖.
* Ridge/Tikhonov/ℓ² regularization: minimize ‖b-Ax‖₂² + δ²‖x‖₂² for some *penalty* δ≠0 to push the solution towards smaller x.  (More generally, δ²‖Dx‖₂² for some matrix D.)  This gives (AᵀA+δ²I)x̂=Aᵀb, which is similar to A⁺b but replaces 1/σ with σ/(σ²+δ²).  Effectively, this drops small σ's, but doesn't require an SVD and generalizes to other types of penalties.  (Example: [VMLS slides pg. 346](https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/vmls/vmls-slides.pdf#page=346).)
* Under-determined problems: for "wide" matrices, Ax=b has many solutions (we can add any N(A) vector to a solution).  A common way to pick a solution is to pick the **minimum-norm** solution: minimize ‖x‖₂ subject to Ax=b.  (It turns out that this gives x̂=A⁺b!)

**Further reading**: Training/test data: [VMLS section 13.2](https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/vmls/vmls.pdf#page=270). Condition numbers: Strang exercises II.3, [OCW video lecture 10](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-065-matrix-methods-in-data-analysis-signal-processing-and-machine-learning-spring-2018/resources/lecture-10-survey-of-difficulties-with-ax-b/), and [these 18.06 notes](https://github.com/mitmath/1806/blob/master/notes/Conditioning.ipynb); a more in-depth treatment can be found in e.g. *Numerical Linear Algebra* by Trefethen and Bau (the 18.335 textbook).  Tikhonov regularization: Strang section II.2, OCW video lecture 10, [VMLS section 15.3](https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/vmls/vmls.pdf#page=326).  Underdetermined minimum-norm solutions: Strang section II.2, [OCW video lecture 11](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-065-matrix-methods-in-data-analysis-signal-processing-and-machine-learning-spring-2018/resources/lecture-11-minimizing-2016x2016-subject-to-ax-b/), [UIUC *Nonlinear Programming* lecture notes](https://faculty.math.illinois.edu/~mlavrov/docs/484-spring-2019/ch4lec4.pdf).

## Lecture 11 (Mar 1)

* Minimum-norm solutions x̂=A⁺b=Aᵀ(AAᵀ)⁻¹: smallest ‖x‖₂ for underdetermined problems Ax=b for "wide" A.
* Other common norms: ℓ¹ and ℓ<sup>∞</sup>, and sparsity with ‖x‖₁ norm ([LASSO regularization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lasso_(statistics))).
* Avoid AᵀA: it squares the condition number κ(AᵀA)=κ(A)²
* Gram–Schmidt orthogonalization and QR factorization.

**Further reading**: Strang II.2, II.4.

## Lecture 12 (Mar 3)

* **QR factorization**: "thin" vs. "full" QR; practical considerations: pivoted QR, instability of classical Gram–Schmidt vs. modified G–S or "G–S twice" or Householder/Givens QR; the fact that many QR algorithms don't give you Q explicitly, only a fast way to multiply Qx or Qᵀy.
* Usage of QR for least-squares problem: AᵀAx̂=Aᵀb ⥰ Rx̂=Qᵀb.   (But this does not mean Ax̂=b!  QQᵀ is orthogonal projection onto C(A), ≠ I in general!)   This avoids squaring the condition number since κ(R)=κ(A).
* **Large-scale linear algebra**:  When solving m×m Ax=b for large m, we have a few options:
  - Dense linear algebra: Gaussian elimination, QR, eigenvalues, SVD, etcetera, assuming that A is just m×m numbers with no special structure.  Cost is Θ(m³), memory is Θ(m²).  Usually you run out of memory before running out of time! (m ∼ 10⁴ is close to filling up memory, but runs in only few minutes.)
  - Sparse-direct methods: For [sparse matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_matrix) (mostly 0), only store and compute with nonzero entries.  If a clever ordering is chosen for rows/cols, Gaussian elimination can often produce mostly sparse L and U factors!  (This is what `A \ b` does in Julia if `A` is a [sparse-matrix type](https://github.com/JuliaSparse/SparseArrays.jl).)   But for very big problems even these methods can eventually run out of memory.
  - Iterative methods: start with a "guess" for x (usually x=0 or x=random), and iteratively make it closer to a solution **using only A-times-vector operations** (and linear combinations and dot products).  Requires a fast A-times-vector, e.g. if A is sparse, low rank, a convolution, or some combination thereof.   Modern methods include [GMRES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_minimal_residual_method), [BiCGSTAB(ℓ)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biconjugate_gradient_stabilized_method), [conjugate gradient (CG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugate_gradient_method), and others.
  - Randomized linear algebra: by multiplying A on the left/right by small random wide/thin matrices, carefully chosen, we can construct an approximate "sketch" of A that can be used to estimate the SVD, solutions to least-squares, etcetera, and can also accelerate iterative solvers.
  - Tricks for special cases: there are various specialized techniques for convolution/circulant matrices (via FFTs), [banded matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Band_matrix) (linear-time methods), and low-rank updates ([Sherman–Morrison formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherman%E2%80%93Morrison_formula))

## Lecture 13 (Mar 6)

* Continued summary of large-scale linear algebra from lecture 12, mentioning randomized algorithms (which we will cover in more detail later), such as "sketched" least-squares and randomized SVD, and also specialized algorithms for particular cases.
* Krylov methods: defined [Krylov subspaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krylov_subspace) reachable by iterative algorithms, defined a Krylov algorithm (loosely) an iterative algorithm that finds the "best" solution in the whole Krylov space (possibly approximately) on the n-th step.  Gave [power iteration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_iteration) for largest |λ| as an example of something *not* a Krylov method.  Explained why the basis (b Ab A²b ⋯) is a poor (ill-conditioned) choice, and instead explained the [Arnoldi iteration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnoldi_iteration) to find an orthonormal basis Qₙ by (essentially) Gram–Schmidt, leading to the [GMRES algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_minimal_residual_method) for Ax=b.

**Further reading:** Arnoldi iterations and GMRES are covered in the Strang textbook section II.1, and briefly in [OCW lecture 12](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-065-matrix-methods-in-data-analysis-signal-processing-and-machine-learning-spring-2018/resources/lecture-12-computing-eigenvalues-and-singular-values/); much more detail is found other sources (Trefethen, etc.) noted in the further reading for Lecture 12.  A review of randomized linear algebra can be found in the Strang textbook sec. II.4, and also in [Halko, Martinsson, and Tropp (2011)](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/10.1137/090771806).  A recent paper on a variety of new randomized algorithms, e.g. for "sketched" least-square problems or to accelerate iterative algorithms like GMRES, is [Nakatsukasa and Tropp (2022)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.00113.pdf).  A nice review of the randomized SVD can be found in a blog post by [Gregory Gundersen (2019)](https://gregorygundersen.com/blog/2019/01/17/randomized-svd/).


## Lecture 14 (Mar 8)

* Krylov wrap-up:
  - GMRES caveats: storage is Θ(mn) after n steps, and cost of orthogonalization is Θ(mn²), so in practice one is often limited to n ≲ 100.  Workarounds include: "[restarted GMRES](https://personal.math.vt.edu/embree/39961.pdf)", randomized "[sketched GMRES](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.00113.pdf)", and approximate Krylov methods such as biCGSTAB(ℓ), QMR, or DQGMRES.   If A is Hermitian positive-definite, however, then there is ideal Krylov method called [conjugate gradient (CG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugate_gradient_method) that "magically" searches the whole Krylov space using only the two most recent search directions on each iteration; CG is [closely related](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0893608003001709) to the "momentum" terms used in stochastic gradient descent / machine learning (covered later in 18.065).
  - GMRES convergence theory is complicated (see e.g. lecture 35 in [Trefethen & Bau](https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/trefethen/text.html)), but basically it converges faster if the eigenvalues are mostly "clustered" (making A more like I).  You can therefore accelerate convergence by finding a [preconditioner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preconditioner) matrix M such that MA has more-clustered eigenvalues (M is a "crude inverse" of A), and then solve MAx=Mb instead of Ax=b.  This can accelerate convergence by orders of magnitude, but finding a good preconditioner is a tricky problem-dependent task.
  - Krylov methods also exist for eigenproblems (e.g. Arnoldi and Jacobi-Davidson methods, or Lanczos and LOPCG for Hermitian problems), the SVD (requiring both Ax and Aᵀy operations), least-squares problems, and so on.
* Randomized linear algebra:
  - Randomized SVD, as covered in these notes by [Gregory Gundersen (2019)](https://gregorygundersen.com/blog/2019/01/17/randomized-svd/)
  - Randomized matrix multiplication AB ≈ random sampling (col j of A)(row j of B)/pⱼ with probability pⱼ. Choosing pⱼ proportional to ‖col j of A‖⋅‖row j of B‖ minimizes the variance of this estimate!  See Strang textbook section II.4 and [OCW lecture 13](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-065-matrix-methods-in-data-analysis-signal-processing-and-machine-learning-spring-2018/resources/lecture-13-randomized-matrix-multiplication/).

## Lecture 15 (Mar 10)

* [Weighted least squares (WLS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_least_squares) and [generalized least squares (GLS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_least_squares): when fitting a model with noisy measurements, we want to *weight* the least-squares minimization inversely with the errors (variances) in the measurements (WLS), or more generally with the inverse of the measurement correlation matrix (GLS); see textbook section V.5.
 - Reviewed correlation matrix V and its positive semidefiniteness/definiteness (textbook section V.4).
 - Framed in terms of minimizing a [weighted ℓ² norm](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/394237/understanding-weighted-inner-product-and-weighted-norms) ‖b-Ax‖<sub>V⁻¹</sub> and gave the WLS formula x̂=(AᵀV⁻¹A)⁻¹AᵀV⁻¹b = Lb.
 - This is an [unbiased estimator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias_of_an_estimator) if the measurement errors are unbiased.
 - Correlation matrix ("error bars") in the estimate x̂ is then given by W=LVLᵀ=(AᵀV⁻¹A)⁻¹ (textbook V.5).
* [Gauss–Markov theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss%E2%80%93Markov_theorem): WLS/GLS is the unbiased linear estimator that *minimizes the variance* of the estimated parameters x.
  - in particular, showed that *any* other unbiased linear estimator gives a covariance W′ = W + (positive semidefinite), which results in ‖W′‖≥‖W‖ in the ℓ² (induced) or Frobenius norms
  - this means that OLS squares is the best choice when the errors are unbiased, independent, and have equal variances (["homoskedastic"](Homoscedasticity_and_heteroscedasticity))

**Further reading:** In addition to the links above, these subjects are covered in countless statistics textbooks and courses.  For example, see [these course notes from CMU](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/mreg/15/lectures/24/lecture-24--25.pdf)


## Lecture 16 (Mar 13)

* [Optimization overview](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1K8BFfd-_6IWML2zpj_V88GvBjuJiK8EPHqYabDMU3CU/edit?usp=sharing) slides

Broad overview of optimization problems (see slides). The most general formulation is actually quite difficult to solve, so most algorithms (especially the most efficient algorithms) solve various special cases, and it is important to know what the key factors are that distinguish a particular problem. There is also something of an art to the problem formulation itself, e.g. a nondifferentiable minimax problem can be reformulated as a nicer differentiable problem with differentiable constraints.

**Further reading:** There are many textbooks on [nonlinear optimization](http://www.athenasc.com/nonlinbook.html) algorithms of various sorts, including specialized books on [convex optimization](http://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/), [derivative-free optimization](http://bookstore.siam.org/mp08/), etcetera.  A useful review of topology-optimization methods can be found in [Sigmund and Maute (2013)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00158-013-0978-6).

## Lecture 17 (Mar 15)

* Matrix calculus — see also [our IAP 2023 course 18.S096](https://github.com/mitmath/matrixcalc).

Reviewed and broadened differential calculus (18.01 and 18.02) from the perspective of 18.06, where we view a derivative f′(x) as a [linear operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_map) acting on a small change in the input (dx) to give you the change in the output (df) to *first order* in dx ("linearized").   This viewpoint makes it easy to generalize derivatives, to scalar-valued functions of vectors where f′(x) is the transposed gradient (∇f)ᵀ, to vector-valued functions of vectors where f′(x) is the [Jacobian matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobian_matrix_and_determinant), and even to matrix-valued functions of matrices like f(x)=A² ⥰ df = A×dA+dA×A or f(x)=A⁻¹ ⥰ df=–A⁻¹×dA×A⁻¹; in both these cases f′(x) is a linear operator f′(x)[dA] that takes dA in and gives df out, but *cannot* be written simply as (matrix)×dA.

Derivatives viewed as linear approximations have many important applications in science, machine learning, statistics, and engineering. For example, ∇f is essential for large-scale optimization of scalar-valued functions f(x), and we will see that *how* you compute the gradient is also critical for practical reasons.  As another example, there is the **multidimensional Newton** algorithm for finding roots f(x)=0 of systems of nonlinear equations: At each step, you just solve a *linear* system of equations with the Jacobian matrix of f(x), and it converges incredibly rapidly.

**Further reading**: This material was presented in much greater depth in our [18.S096: Matrix Calculus](https://github.com/mitmath/matrixcalc) course in IAP 2022 and IAP 2023.    The viewpoint of derivatives as linear operators (also called [Fréchet derivatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fr%C3%A9chet_derivative)) was covered in lectures 1 and 2 of 18.S096, Newton's method was covered in lecture 4, and automatic differentiation was covered in lectures 5 and 8 — see the posted lecture materials and the further-reading links therein.   This [notebook](https://nbviewer.org/github/mitmath/1806/blob/fall22/notes/Newton-Thomson-example.ipynb) has a Newton's method example demo where we solve a 2d version of the famous [Thomson problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomson_problem) to find the equilibrium position of N repulsive "point charges" constrained to lie on a circle; more generally, a sphere or hypersphere.

## Lecture 18 (Mar 17)

* d(A⁻¹), adjoint problems, chain rules, and forward vs reverse mode (backpropagation) derivatives
* [pset 3 solutions](psets/pset3sol.ipynb)
* [pset 4](psets/pset4.ipynb), due 4/7

Showed that d(A⁻¹)=–A⁻¹ dA A⁻¹.  (For example, if you have a matrix A(t) that depends on a scalar t∈ℝ, this tells you that d(A⁻¹)/dt = –A⁻¹ dA/dt A⁻¹.)   Applied this to computing ∇ₚf for scalar functions f(A⁻¹b) where A(p) depends on some parameters p∈ℝⁿ, and showed that ∂f/∂pᵢ = -(∇ₓf)ᵀA⁻¹(∂A/∂pᵢ)x.  Moreover, showed that it is critically important to evaluate this expression from *left to right*, i.e. first computing vᵀ=-(∇ₓf)ᵀA⁻¹m, which corresponds to solving the "adjoint (transposed) equation" Aᵀv=–∇ₓf.  By doing so, you can compute both f and ∇ₚf at the cost of only "two solves" with matrices A and Aᵀ.  This is critically important in enabling engineering/physics optimization, where you often want to optimize a property of the solution A⁻¹b of a physical model A depending on many design variables p (e.g. the distribution of materials in space).

More generally, presented the chain rule for f(g(x)) (f'(x)=g'(h(x))h'(x), where this is a *composition* of two linear operations, performing h' then g' — g'h' ≠ h'g'!).   For functions from vectors to vectors, the chain rule is simply the *product of Jacobians*.   Moreover, as soon as you compose 3 or more functions, it can a make a huge difference whether you multiply the Jacobians from left-to-right ("reverse-mode", or "backpropagation", or "adjoint differentiation") or right-to-left ("forward-mode"). Showed, for example, that if you have *many inputs but a single output* (as is common in machine learning and other types of optimization problem), that it is vastly more efficient to multiply left-to-right than right-to-left, and such "backpropagation algorithms" are a key factor in the practicality of large-scale optimization (including machine learning and neural nets).

You can find many, many articles online about [backpropagation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation) in neural networks.  This [video on the principles of AD in Julia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqymrMG-Qi4) by [Dr. Mohamed Tarek](https://github.com/mohamed82008) also starts with a similar left-to-right (reverse) vs right-to-left (forward) viewpoint and goes into how it translates to Julia code, and how you define custom chain-rule steps for Julia AD.
